# xr-terminal
An XRPackage for spawning terminals.

Run it using the [XRPackage](https://github.com/webaverse/xrpackage) library.

If you have xrpk installed, you can run `build.sh` to generate an `xr-terminal.wbn` package.

## What does it do?

So far, it renders a terminal in your face in VR and on the page in 2D.
The terminal has a read/eval/print loop so you can mess around with JS expressions.
